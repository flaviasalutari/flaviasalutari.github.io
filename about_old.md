### Me 

Hi! My name is Flavia Salutari, I was born in the middle of the 90s in L'Aquila, a lovely but unlucky town in Central Italy.

I am currently set in Paris where I work as a data scientist at BNP Paribas.

In 2018, I took a leap of faith into the captivating world of academia, pursuing a Ph.D. with dreams of making a difference. 

Until June 2021 I was a Computer Science PhD student at [**Telecom Paris**](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) and [**Institut Polytechnique de Paris**](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), under the supervision of [Mauro Sozio](https://sites.google.com/site/maurosozio/) and [Dario Rossi](https://nonsns.github.io/). 


Before, I was a visiting PhD student at the **University College London** (UCL) in the [Web Intelligence Group](http://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and in the [SpaceTimeLab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/research/groups-centres-and-sections/spacetimelab) working under the supervision of [Aldo Lipani](https://aldolipani.com/) on the measurement of societal biases embedded in language models.

Previously, I worked 9 months as Research and Development engineer at Telecom Paris, under the supervision of [Dario Rossi](https://nonsns.github.io/). 

I obtained both my B.Sc. (TLC Engineering July'15) and my M.Sc. (ICT for Smart Societies October'17) at **[Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en)**.

More details about my professional and academic career can be found in [my cv](/resume/index.html) (that can as well be downloaded in its more compact version as a [pdf](/assets/flaviasalutariCV_eng_2023.pdf)). 

### My research 

I have a strong intersciplinary background, and as such I am interested in the applications of Computer and Data Science knowledge in several domains, in particular those who are sustainable and positive for the society. 

Recently, I have been working on ethical AI. Specifically, I focused on the measurement and analysis of linguistic bias embedded in transformer-based language models, e.g. BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, etc.

During my PhD, I had the privilege to work with human-labeled data coming from real browsing measurements thanks to a [collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Study_of_performance_perception_on_Wikimedia_projects) aimed at studying the users' performance perception on Wikipedia pages. In this context, I worked on the analysis and on the prediction of [Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users](https://webqoe.telecom-paristech.fr/), a topic which covers various disciplines, notably computer networks, social psychology, cognitive science and economics. 


You can find my publications and technical reports [in this section](/publications) of the website or by visiting [my Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=vfZgNcwAAAAJ&hl=).

### The blog
Why did I feel this urge to start writing a blog? The answer lies probably in the fact that blogging is a [common need for academics](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/dec/02/why-do-academics-blog-research). In the [blog](/blog/) section of this site you may find posts related to different topics. I no longer have time to keep this site updated as I would have liked but I hope you will enjoy anyway my old content.
<!-- 
In my case, this came as a heed for personal development. 
I ~~am~~ was a bit messy (trying to get better :)) and hopefully the [blog](/blog/) section of this website will help me in learning how to better **organize my thoughts** in a more structured manner. -->

<!-- ### What is the substance?
At the moment, I don't have a plan, so expect to come across **different topics**, possibly ranging from stuff more related to my research field to things I learnt, studied, experienced in other areas of my life. -->
